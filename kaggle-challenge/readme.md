# Kaggle Competition Presentations

**For Instructors**: Remember to choose a Kaggle competition to share with the class in advance of class 5. There are many to choose from and you may want to select something topical.

**For Students**: 

During this last class each student will be asked to give a short (5-8 minute) presentation regarding their work on a Kaggle competition selected by the instructor. Here are two things you must do:

* Explore the data: make a few charts that highlight anything interesting you discover.
* Build a model: use `sklearn` to make at least one machine learning model and evaluate your results.
* Present your results to the class.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* You can present slides, code, a Jupyter notebook or a combination of all three.
* You may use any algorithms you like (though we suggest sticking with the ones provided by `sklearn`)
    * You may wish to try and compare several algorithms!
* Focus on learning more than getting a top-tier result.
    * Share your challenges, not just your successes.
    * Don't worry if you never get a great result, that's pretty normal.
    * Do explore why your results aren't as good as you'd like and share a hypothesis for **why** you're getting this result and **how** you might improve it!

This project is intentionally open-ended, challenge yourself by going above and beyond what we learned in class. Learn a new ML algorithm. Preprocess the data and attempt some "feature engineering." Create a really satisfying chart. 

Good luck!
